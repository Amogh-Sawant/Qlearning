# Qlearning
Trying to implement q learning using pygame as display screen. The agent(white) has to reach its goal(green) avoiding enemies(red). The initial position of agent and enemies changes each episode. The agent is still pretty stupid, need to tinker with hyper-paramerters. Pretrained Q-Table included.
